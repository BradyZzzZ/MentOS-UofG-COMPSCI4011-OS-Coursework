For Task 3:

1. Thinking process

	For Task 3, my first thought was to create a file just like "cat.c" in the "program" folder to run the observe program, so I created the new file and started implementing the main function. Then I started with the detection of the number of command line arguments and the provision of "--help", just like in "cat.c". After that I try to deal with the while-infinite-loop to run the specified command in a loop. I use "fork()" to fork the process to run with loop, and I check if the fork program is successful. Then I get the new PID and set to the process. After that, I use "execvp(argv[1], &argv[1])" to run the command each time (Note: although it may not run properly on my Mac, I believe that it should be correct in both logic and code format). Finally, I use "sleep(2)" to ensure that the command only runs every two seconds.


2. My observation

	I have found that "fork()" is very powerful, but at the same time, it is important to check whether the fork is successful. Similarly, when running a specified command with "execvp()", it is also important to pay attention to whether the parameters passed in match with the function definition. Additionally, Control+C cannot be directly used to terminate programs in MentOS, and additional code may be required to implement this feature


3. Comments(Notes)

	while (1) {

        	pid_t cpid = fork();

        	if (cpid == -1) {
            		perror("fork");
            		exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        	}

        	if (cpid == 0) {
            		// Makes the new process a group leader
            		pid_t pid = getpid();
            		setpgid(cpid, pid);

            		if (execvp(argv[1], &argv[1]) == -1) {
                		printf("\nUnknown command: %s\n", argv[1]);
                		exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
            		}
        	}
        
        	sleep(2);
    	}


	For this part of the while-infinite-loop, I thinl there are no bugs, but "execvp(argv[1] ,&argv[1])" does not run properly on my Mac (it keeps printing "Unknown command:" instead of running the command), and I don't know why.
